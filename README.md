# Contributing to the translated content of MDN Web Docs

:tada: First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)' translated content! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the [translated content of MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content), which is hosted within the [MDN Organization](https://github.com/mdn) on GitHub.

[Guidelines for peers can be found here](PEERS_GUIDELINES.md).

## Locales

Before we go any further, you should be aware that we are only accepting updates to active locales — this means locales that have active community maintenance teams in place to review PRs, fix issues, make updates, etc. Currently the list of active locales is:

- `fr`
- `ja`
- `ko`
- `pt-BR`
- `ru`
- `zh` (`zh-CN` and `zh-TW`)
- `es`

If you want to just find a task and jump in, search by the labels `l10n-fr`, `l10n-ja`, `l10n-ko`, `l10n-pt-br`, `l10n-ru`, `l10n-zh` and `l10n-es` in this repo's [issues list](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/issues), or the main [content repo issues](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues).
