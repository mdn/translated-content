<p>MDN is made up of a vast community of contributors. While we can't offer profiles of all of them (we'd be here for a very long time!), we can share something about a few of the ones who have made substantial or important contributions, as well as those who are most likely to be available on the <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs chat room</a> to help you out if you could use some assistance with your contributions.</p>
