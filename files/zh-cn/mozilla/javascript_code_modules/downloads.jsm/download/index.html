<p> <code>Download</code> 对象仅仅表示下载，同时包含相关的状态和行为。这个对象是短时存在的，但是它可被包含在<a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm/DownloadList" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm/DownloadList"><code>DownloadList</code></a> 对象，因此它能够通过用户接口调用和跨sessions.</p>

<p>调用<a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm#createDownload()" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm#createDownload()"><code>Downloads.createDownload()</code></a> 方法可以创建一个新的<code>Download</code> 对象。</p>

<h2 id="方法">方法</h2>

<h3 id="start()">start()</h3>

<p>Starts the download for the first time, or restarts a download that failed or has been canceled.</p>

<p>Calling this method when the download has been completed successfully has no effect, and the method returns a resolved promise. If the download is in progress, the method returns the same promise as the previous call.</p>

<p>If the <code><a href="#cancel()" title="#cancel()">cancel()</a></code> method was called but the cancellation process has not finished yet, this method waits for the cancellation to finish, then restarts the download immediately.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you need to start a new download from the same source, rather than restarting a failed or canceled one, you should create a separate <code>Download</code> object with the same source as the current one.</div>

<pre>Promise start();
</pre>

<h6 id="Parameters">Parameters</h6>

<p>None.</p>

<h6 id="Promise_resolves_to">Promise resolves to</h6>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the download has finished successfully and you can access the target file.</p>

<h6 id="Promise_can_be_rejected_with">Promise can be rejected with</h6>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm/DownloadError" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Downloads.jsm/DownloadError"><code>DownloadError</code></a> if the download failed.</p>

<h3 id="launch()">launch()</h3>

<p>Opens or executes the target file after download has completed.</p>

<p>If the <code>launcherPath</code> property is <code>null</code>, the file will be opened with the default application for the MIME type specified in the <code>contentType</code> property. If the content type is not available, an attempt will be made to obtain it from the extension of the target file.</p>

<p>If the <code>launcherPath</code> property is set, the file will be opened with the specified custom application.</p>

<pre>Promise launch();
</pre>

<h6 id="Parameters_2">Parameters</h6>

<p>None.</p>

<h6 id="Promise_resolves_to_2">Promise resolves to</h6>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the instruction to launch the file has been successfully given to the operating system. Note that the OS might still take a while until the file is actually launched.</p>

<h3 id="showContainingDirectory()">showContainingDirectory()</h3>

<p>Shows the folder containing the target file, or where the target file will be saved. This may be called at any time, even if the download failed or is currently in progress.</p>

<pre>Promise showContainingDirectory();
</pre>

<h6 id="Parameters_3">Parameters</h6>

<p>None.</p>

<h6 id="Promise_resolves_to_3">Promise resolves to</h6>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the instruction to open the containing folder has been successfully given to the operating system. Note that the OS might still take a while until the folder is actually opened.</p>

<h3 id="cancel()">cancel()</h3>

<p>Cancels the download.</p>

<p>The cancellation request is asynchronous. Until the cancellation process finishes, temporary files or part files may still exist even if they are expected to be deleted.</p>

<p>In case the download completes successfully before the cancellation request could be processed, this method has no effect, and it returns a resolved promise. You should check the properties of the download at the time the returned promise is resolved to determine if the download was canceled.</p>

<p>Calling this method when the download has been completed successfully, failed, or has been canceled has no effect, and the method returns a resolved promise. This behavior is designed for the case where the call to <code>cancel</code> happens asynchronously, and is consistent with the case where the cancellation request could not be processed in time.</p>

<pre>Promise cancel();
</pre>

<h6 id="Parameters_4">Parameters</h6>

<p>None.</p>

<h6 id="Promise_resolves_to_4">Promise resolves to</h6>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the cancellation process has finished.</p>

<h6 id="Promise_can_be_rejected_with_2">Promise can be rejected with</h6>

<p>Never rejected.</p>

<h3 id="removePartialData()">removePartialData()</h3>

<p>Removes any partial data kept as part of a canceled or failed download.</p>

<p>If the download is not canceled or failed, this method has no effect, and it returns a resolved promise. If the <code><a href="#cancel()" title="#cancel()">cancel()</a></code> method was called but the cancellation process has not finished yet, this method waits for the cancellation to finish, then removes the partial data.</p>

<p>After this method has been called, if the <code>tryToKeepPartialData</code> property is still <code>true</code> when the download is restarted, partial data will be retained during the new download attempt.</p>

<pre>Promise removePartialData();
</pre>

<h5 id="Parameters_5">Parameters</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="Promise_resolves_to_5">Promise resolves to</h5>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the partial data has been successfully removed.</p>

<h3 id="whenSucceeded()">whenSucceeded()</h3>

<p>Returns a promise that is resolved as soon as this download finishes successfully, even if the download was stopped and restarted meanwhile.</p>

<p>You can use this property for scheduling download completion actions in the current session, for downloads that are controlled interactively. If the download is not controlled interactively, you should use the promise returned by the <a href="#start()" title="#start()"><code>start()</code></a> method instead, to check for success or failure.</p>

<pre>Promise whenSucceeded();
</pre>

<h5 id="Parameters_6">Parameters</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="Promise_resolves_to_6">Promise resolves to</h5>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the download has finished successfully and you can access the target file.</p>

<h5 id="Promise_can_be_rejected_with_3">Promise can be rejected with</h5>

<p>Never rejected.</p>

<h3 id="finalize()">finalize()</h3>

<p>Ensures that the download is stopped, and optionally removes any partial data kept as part of a canceled or failed download. After this method has been called, the download cannot be started again.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method should be used in place of the <code><a href="#cancel()" title="#cancel()">cancel()</a></code> and <a href="#removePartialData()" title="#removePartialData()"><code>removePartialData()</code></a> methods while shutting down or disposing of the download object, to prevent other callers from interfering with the operation. This is required because cancellation and other operations are asynchronous.</div>

<pre>Promise finalize(
  boolean aRemovePartialData
);
</pre>

<h5 id="Parameters_7">Parameters</h5>

<dl>
 <dt><code>aRemovePartialData</code> {{optional_inline()}}</dt>
 <dd>Whether any partially downloaded data should be removed after the download has been stopped. The default is <code>false</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<h5 id="Promise_resolves_to_7">Promise resolves to</h5>

<p><code>undefined</code> when the operation has finished successfully.</p>
