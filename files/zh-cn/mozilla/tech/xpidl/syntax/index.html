<h3 id="Status_of_this_document" name="Status_of_this_document">Status of this document</h3>

<p>This is a partial reverse-engineering of the libIDL source code's parser, limited mostly to the subset of functionality that is supported by the Mozilla xpidl binary.</p>

<h3 id="Purpose_of_this_document" name="Purpose_of_this_document">Purpose of this document</h3>

<p>This document is <strong>not</strong> an introduction to XPIDL or IDL in general. It is more focused on XPIDL syntax and grammar. See <a href="/en/XPIDL" title="en/XPIDL">XPIDL Main Page</a> for more links and introductory content.</p>

<h3 id="Simplifications.2C_conventions_and_notation" name="Simplifications.2C_conventions_and_notation">Simplifications, conventions and notation</h3>

<p>The syntax is specified according to ABNF as defined by <a class="external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234">RFC 5234</a>, although a few productions use prose for clarity of understanding.</p>

<p>Lexically, tokens are delimited by whitespace (defined here as spaces, tabs, vertical tabs, form feeds, line feeds, and carriage returns, or [ \t\v\f\r\n] in regular expression form). LibIDL only considers a single line feed as a newline, and not carriage returns (although xpidl begs to differ). Additionally, the use of both C-style (/* ... */) and C++-style (// ... end-of-line) comments are permitted between any two tokens.</p>

<p>Some productions can only occur at the beginning of lines; to simplify the grammar, I will not mention them in the grammar, especially since they are handled as a preprocessing step before the IDL source code is actually parsed.</p>

<ol>
 <li>A `<code>%{</code>' that appears at the beginning of a line is the start of a <strong>raw code fragment</strong>, which extends until the end of a line that begins with `<code>%}</code>'. Text inside raw code fragments are not otherwise parsed by xpidl directly. This may be followed by the language, as in `<code>%{C++</code>', to output the raw fragment only in the specified language.</li>
 <li>A `<code>#include "file"</code>' line instructs the xpidl processor to include that file in the same sense that the C preprocessor includes a file. Note that includes within comments or raw code fragments are not processed by xpidl. Unlike the C preprocessor, when a file is included multiple times, it acts as if the subsequent includes did not happen; this prevents the need for include guards.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Functionality_not_used_in_xpidl">Functionality not used in xpidl</h3>

<p>The libIDL parser we use is more powerful than xpidl itself can understand. The following is a list of potential features which are parseable but may not result in expected code:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Struct, union, and enumerated types</li>
 <li>Array declarators (appears to be supported in xpidl_header.c but not xpidl_typelib.c)</li>
 <li>Exception declarations</li>
 <li>Module declarations</li>
 <li>Variable arguments (that makes the ABNF get more wonky)</li>
 <li>Sequence types</li>
 <li>Max-length strings</li>
 <li>Fixed-point numbers</li>
 <li>"any" and "long double" types.</li>
</ul>
