  Gaia is the collection of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/apps" rel="nofollow">web apps</a> which make up the front end of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a>. Everything you see on the screen in Firefox OS is built using open Web technologies. This includes the home screen and all the default apps.

  Market customizations allow you to specify build-time customization instructions (for example, which apps should be included in your build) in separate directories, without modifying the core Gaia repo. You can include your own customizations in distinct directories, or use the preexisting directories that come with the source. These customizations are specified with build options. In this article we look in detail at how to create and use these customizations.</dd>
