<h2 id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Midas is the code name for Gecko's built-in rich text editor. Midas can be enabled via JavaScript on an HTML document. When Midas is enabled, the document becomes editable by the user. Scripting for Midas is based on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533049.aspx">DHTML commands</a> supported by Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer supports the ability to make an entire document editable by setting the <code>designMode</code> property of the {{domxref("document")}} object; this is how Midas is invoked in Gecko. Internet Explorer also supports the ability to edit specific elements using the <code>contentEditable</code> attribute; Starting with Firefox 3, Gecko also supports <code>contentEditable</code>. Once Midas is invoked, a few more methods of the <code>document</code> object become available.</p>

<h2 id="Properties" name="Properties">Properties</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Midas/designMode">document.designMode</a></dt>
 <dd>By setting this property to "on", the document becomes editable.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Notes" name="Notes">Notes</h2>

<p>Since an entire document becomes editable, authors often load the editable document into an <code>IFRAME</code> and do the bulk of the scripting in the parent document. According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/html.html#ID-50708718">standards</a>, The <code>IFRAME</code> element has the <code>contentDocument</code> property that refers to the document in the inline frame. It also has a property called <code>contentWindow</code> that refers to the window object inside the inline frame. This also avoids problems with {{bug(198155)}}.</p>

<p>In addition to the built-in commands, advanced editing can be done by manipulating the {{domxref("Selection")}} and {{domxref("range")}} objects. It is beneficial to be familiar with these objects when working with an editable document.</p>

<h2 id="Examples" name="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This example shows the basic structure described in the Notes section :</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Simple Edit Box&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;iframe
			id="MidasForm"
			src="about:blank"
			onload="this.contentDocument.designMode='on';"
		&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
