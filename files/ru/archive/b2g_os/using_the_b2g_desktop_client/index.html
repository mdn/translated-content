<p>The Firefox OS desktop client, also called the <em>B2G desktop client</em>, lets you run Gaia and web apps in a Gecko-based environment somewhat similar to an actual device. It doesn't emulate device hardware, so it's not adequate for testing device APIs, and isn't a replacement for testing on actual hardware. However, it does have a several APIs enabled that aren't available on Firefox such as the Contacts and Settings APIs. It can therefore be useful during the development of our application, or while working on the Gaia user interface itself.</p>
<p>This article covers downloading or building the Firefox OS desktop client, as well as how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="Download_a_nightly_build">Download a nightly build</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org" title="http://nightly.mozilla.org">Firefox Nightlies</a>, the Firefox OS desktop client is built every day from the latest source code. The latest build is <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/" title="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/">available from the Mozilla FTP server</a>. Be sure to pick the latest version and the right archive for your operating system.</p>
<p>We can now skip ahead to <a href="#Running_the_desktop_client" title="#Running_the_desktop_client">Running the desktop client</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Building_the_desktop_client">Building the desktop client</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is set up a <a href="/En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions#Build_prerequisites" title="En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions#Build_prerequisites">standard Mozilla build environment</a>. Once we have that, we can pull down the code we'll need and configure to build the Firefox OS desktop client.</p>
<h3 id="Downloading_the_code_for_the_first_time">Downloading the code for the first time</h3>
<p>In a directory where we'd like the source code to go, let's clone the <code>mozilla-central</code> repository that contains all of Gecko:</p>
<pre> hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
</pre>
<h3 id="Updating_the_code">Updating the code</h3>
<p>When we do subsequent builds later, we'll want to make sure we have the latest code. Here's how to pull the latest changes:</p>
<pre>cd mozilla-central
hg pull -u
</pre>
<h3 id="Create_a_mozconfig">Create a mozconfig</h3>
<p>Next, we need to create a <code>mozconfig</code> file in the <code>mozilla-central</code> directory to configure the build system to build the Boot to Gecko client instead of Firefox:</p>
<pre>mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=../build
mk_add_options MOZ_MAKE_FLAGS="-j9 -s"

ac_add_options --enable-application=b2g
ac_add_options --disable-libjpeg-turbo

# This option is required if you want to be able to run Gaia's tests
ac_add_options --enable-tests

# turn on mozTelephony/mozSms interfaces
# Only turn this line on if you actually have a dev phone
# you want to forward to. If you get crashes at startup,
# make sure this line is commented.
#ac_add_options --enable-b2g-ril</pre>
<h3 id="Building">Building</h3>
<p>Now we're ready to build the desktop client with the following command issued from the <code>mozilla-central</code> directory:</p>
<pre>make -f client.mk
</pre>
<p>The built client will be placed in the <code>../build/dist</code> directory (based on the value you specify for <code>MOZ_OBJDIR</code> in the <code>mozconfig</code> file).</p>
<h2 id="Running_the_desktop_client">Running the desktop client</h2>
<p>By default the desktop client will show an empty screen because it doesn't know which web app to load initially as the system app. The collection of system apps and default apps that come with Firefox OS is called Gaia.</p>
<h3 id="Downloading_Gaia">Downloading Gaia</h3>
<p>To download Gaia for the first time, let's clone the source code repository on GitHub:</p>
<pre> git clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia</pre>
<p>To update an already existing clone of Gaia, we can pull in the latest changes from GitHub:</p>
<pre>cd gaia
git pull
</pre>
<h3 id="Generating_a_profile">Generating a profile</h3>
<p>Next we need to set up Gaia's apps for the desktop client. This includes packaging the Gaia apps in the same way like they would be installed on the device, as well as setting up the permissions for the privileged system apps. We do this by generating a profile. The following command will take care of that: The new profile contains a customized extension and other configuration needed to make B2G run properly. So do this in the <code>gaia</code> directory:</p>
<pre>cd gaia
make
</pre>
<p>This should create a <code>profile</code> directory below the <code>gaia</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="Running_on_Linux">Running on Linux</h3>
<p>To run the desktop client against the Gaia profile we just generate, we simply invoke the <code>b2g</code> binary with the profile parameter. The binary will be located in the tarball we downloaded earlier or in the <code>../build/dist/bin</code> directory if we built the client ourselves.</p>
<pre>.../b2g -profile gaia/profile
</pre>
<p>You may experience annoying rendering problems. To avoid them, add the following line to your <code>gaia/profile/prefs.js</code> file:</p>
<pre>user_pref("layers.acceleration.disabled", true);
</pre>
<h3 id="Running_on_Mac">Running on Mac</h3>
<p>On Mac, the command line is slightly more complicated due to the location of the <code>b2g</code> binary and the need for absolute paths when specifying the profile directory:</p>
<pre>.../B2G.app/Contents/MacOS/b2g -profile /full/path/to/gaia/profile
</pre>
<h2 id="Command_line_options">Command line options</h2>
<p>There are a number of command line options you can use to adjust the runtime experience while using the desktop client. You can get a list by using the <code>-help</code> option. This section covers some of the particularly interesting ones.</p>
<h3 id="option-screen" name="option-screen">Specifying the screen size</h3>
<p>You can specify the screen size of the device you want to simulate using the <code>--screen</code> option:</p>
<pre>b2g --screen=<em>&lt;width&gt;</em>x<em>&lt;height&gt;</em>[@<em>&lt;dpi&gt;</em>]</pre>
<p>Where <em>&lt;width&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;height&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;dpi&gt;</em> are fairly self-explanatory parameters: the width and height of the device's screen in pixels and the device resolution in DPI. For example:</p>
<pre>b2g --screen=320x480
b2g --screen=320x480@160
</pre>
<p>Optionally, you can specify certain devices by name to simulate their screen size and resolution:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>iphone</code></li>
  <li><code>ipad</code></li>
  <li><code>nexus_s</code></li>
  <li><code>galaxy_nexus</code></li>
  <li><code>galaxy_tab</code></li>
  <li><code>wildfire</code></li>
  <li><code>tattoo</code></li>
  <li><code>salsa</code></li>
  <li><code>chacha</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="option-console" name="option-console">Opening the JavaScript console</h3>
<p>You can open the JavaScript console when launching the desktop B2G client by launching it from the command line with the <code>-jsconsole</code> flag. After building, just do:</p>
<pre>.../b2g -jsconsole -profile <em>/path/to/your/profile</em></pre>
<p>If you've installed the nightly build on a Mac, you can do the following:</p>
<pre>/Applications/B2G.app/Contents/MacOS/b2g -jsconsole -profile <em>/path/to/your/profile</em></pre>
<h3 id="option-runapp" name="option-runapp">Launching a specific application at startup</h3>
<p>You can now specify an application to be launched automatically when b2g starts up in the desktop client. This is done as soon as the rest of the system is done loading up. To do this, just use the <code>--runapp</code> option, which takes as a parameter the name of the application to run. For example:</p>
<pre> .../b2g -profile <em>/path/to/your/gaia/profile</em> --runapp email</pre>
<p>Before looking for an app to launch, the specified name is normalized by converting it to all lower case and removing all dashes and spaces. This normalized name is then compared to similarly normalized names from the manifests of available apps' manifests.</p>
<p>For example, the name of the email app is currently "E-mail", but <code>--runapp email</code> will work because of this normalization.</p>
<p>If you specify the <code>--runapp</code> option without an argument, or with an empty argument, the b2g client will output to your terminal a list of the known applications as well as a brief usage message.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the <code>--runapp</code> option disables the lock screen as a side effect and does not re-enable it. It's assumed that you won't use this command on a profile on which you will be testing the lock screen, or you will turn it back on manually. Feel free to contribute a patch to change this behavior if it's a problem.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_tips">Usage tips</h2>
<p>This section provides a few helpful tips to using the B2G desktop client.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ESC key performs the same function as the "back" button.</li>
  <li>The Home key performs the same function as the "home" button; if you're on a Mac, the Home key is available as Fn+← (Fn + Left Arrow).</li>
</ul>
