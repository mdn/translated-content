<p><span class="seoSummary">There are two main types of debugging you'll want to with Firefox OS: debugging apps, and debugging other aspects of the system.</span> This section of the site provides articles covering the different tools at your disposal to debug your Firefox OS code.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Debugging_apps">Debugging apps</h2>

<p>When debugging your web apps, the best tool at your disposal is Mozilla's powerful <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a>, which allows you to run your apps directly on a real device or simulator, update any changes instantly, and debug them directly on the device using Mozilla's excellent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools" title="en-US/docs/Tools">developer tools</a>. This should be your first choice, especially for app/Gaia debugging.</p>
