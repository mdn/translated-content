<p>Please remember that the following is only a rough guideline. The more effort you put into preparing your testday, the more likely it is to be successful. Give yourself, and the community, ample time to prepare for the event. Above all else, experiment and have fun with your test day.</p>

<h4 id="Planning_Your_Event">Planning Your Event</h4>

<div>The following should be done no later than one week before your event:</div>

<div> </div>

 <li>Create a test plan to define success criteria, declare a designated spot for signups for mentors, set a schedule (e.g, <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/testday-20141024">past event test-plan</a>)</li>
 <li>Publicize and post the event on QMO (if need be, ask QA staff in IRC for assistance) — a valuable post must contain a request for mentorship sign-up and links to available documentation (e.g, <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/2014/09/volunteers-needed-for-testdays-relaunch-initiative/">see past event notice</a>)</li>
 <li>Broadcast your event — Follow our suggested communication list below to help broadcast and publicize the event</li>

<h3 id="QMO_Event_Page"><a name="event"></a>QMO Event Page</h3>

<p>The week before a testday we need to create a QMO event page.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Once you are logged in (yes you need to be authenticated) simply click on the left to add a <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/wp-admin/post-new.php">new post</a></li>
 <li>Your title should indicate the topic and date (ie. Firefox Aurora Bugday May 6th)</li>
 <li>Start out by giving a small summary of the topic, goals, and when the event takes place.</li>
 <li>Give some context as to why this event/activity is necessary and valuable.</li>
 <li>Give some encouragement for people who have absolutely no experience to attend.</li>
 <li>Frame the language of your post with "making Firefox better", show them what benefit their contributions provide (no matter how big or small).</li>
 <li>Provide a link to your testplan etherpad and a mibbit URL so people without IRC clients can join easily.</li>
 <li>Be sure to thank them in advance for attending.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an example of an excellent <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/events/2011/02/28/add-ons-compatibility-and-add-ons-manager-testday-march-4th/">QMO Event</a> page. <strong>Before posting make sure you:</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>"Is this post an event?" is set to "Yes" below</li>
 <li>"All day event?" is unchecked and the date/times are properly set (all times in PDT)</li>
 <li>All other event details can be left blank</li>
 <li>On the right under "Categories", check "Events", "QMO News" and any appropriate "Teams"</li>
 <li><strong>Make sure you SAVE DRAFT and PREVIEW before publishing</strong> (if you have to, get someone else to review)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="QMO_Blog_Post"><a name="blog"></a>QMO Blog Post</h3>

<p>The day before the testday, simply create a post which reminds people that a testday is happening <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The title should be similar to "REMINDER: Firefox Aurora Testday Tomorrow!"</li>
 <li>The message should summarize the activity, time, a mibbit URL to the channel, and a link to the QMO Event page for more information</li>
 <li>Be sure to thank them ahead of time for attending</li>
 <li>Be sure the "Categories" on the right are set to "QMO News"</li>
 <li><strong>Make sure you SAVE DRAFT and PREVIEW before publishing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good example of a <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/qmo-news/2011/03/24/testday-reminder-mozmill-crowd-and-endurance-testing/">QMO Event Reminder</a>. Your post should be syndicated to Planet within 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

<h3 id="QMO_Results_Post"><a name="results"></a>QMO Results Post</h3>

<p>The day after a testday, create another post which highlights the results.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The title should be similar to "Results of the Firefox Aurora Testday"</li>
 <li>The message should summarize the activity and the value it provided</li>
 <li>Highlight some of the results (number of bugs filed, number of bugs confirmed/verified, number of testers, etc)</li>
 <li>Identify and thank the top tester</li>
 <li>Identify and thank some of the people who were runners up for the top-tester</li>
 <li>Give general thanks to everyone who helped</li>
 <li>Provide a link to the next testday (should it be available) and ask people to come back to help</li>
 <li>Be sure the "Categories" on the right are set to "QMO News"<strong> </strong></li>
 <li><strong>Make sure you SAVE DRAFT and PREVIEW before publishing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good example of a <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/qmo-news/2011/04/26/results-of-the-aurora-422-testday/">QMO Results Post</a>. Your post should be syndicated to Planet within 30 minutes to an hour.  </p>
