<div id="magicdomid3"><span class="author-p-1460">When it comes to translation, </span><span class="author-p-1460">meaning is everything. We encourage you to consider the source text's meaning and find its most closely linked equal in your own language. Avoid literal translation at all costs. Finding meaning-based equivalents between languages can be difficult. To help concentrate your thoughts, ask yourself questions like:</span></div>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li id="magicdomid4"><span class="author-p-1460">What does this word/sentence/string mean in English?</span></li>
 <li id="magicdomid5"><span class="author-p-1460">What is the message the author is trying to send?</span></li>
 <li id="magicdomid6"><span class="author-p-1460">How would I express that meaning in my own language?</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ব্যবহার"><span class="author-p-1460 b"><strong>ব্যবহার</strong></span></h3>

<div id="magicdomid10"><span class="author-p-1460">    The target audience and their relationship with the Mozilla product determines a translation's usage. A determined translation usage is often maintained throughout a product localization, and even across various products within a single category.</span></div>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li><span class="author-p-1460">For Mozilla desktop products, the target audience is general users with all levels of technical ability. This could indicate more formal language in the UI as the target audience's relationship with desktop products is less frequent. </span>It could, however, indicate informal language due to the level of implied trust between a user and their browser.</li>
 <li id="magicdomid11"><span class="author-p-1460">For Mozilla mobile products, the target audience is general users carrying mobile devices. This could indicate more informal language in the UI as the target audience's relationship with a mobile device is interpreted to be more intimate and an extension of oneself. </span></li>
 <li id="magicdomid12"><span class="author-p-1460">For Mozilla web pages, the target audience will vary according to the purpose of the web page. Seek to identify the web project's purpose and intended audience before translating strings.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Brevity"><span class="author-p-1460 b"><strong>Brevity</strong></span></h3>

<div id="magicdomid15"><span class="author-p-1460">    Space is limited in product user interfaces. There may be specific space limitations for each string. Pay close attention to where the string is being used within the product you are localizing. When selecting an accurate translation, keep in mind that your translation should be brief while still maintaining the original meaning.</span></div>

When translating strings with trailing whitespaces before or after a string's text, seek to identify the corresponding string to learn how to appropriately translate the content. If you are unsure where the corresponding string is, ask around in the mozilla.dev.l10n newsgroup or file a bug in the appropriate product.</span><span class="author-p-1460">            </span></dd>

<div id="magicdomid62"><span class="author-p-1460">            Translating terms representing difficult concepts is a tricky task. Here are some ideas to help you translate terms that do not have equivalents in your language:</span></div>

<ol style="margin-left: 80px;">
 <li id="magicdomid63"><span class="author-p-1460">Understand the meaning of the term in English.</span></li>
 <li id="magicdomid64"><span class="author-p-1460">Understand the function of the feature.</span></li>
 <li id="magicdomid65"><span class="author-p-1460">Consider similar ideas for those functions in your culture.</span></li>
 <li id="magicdomid66"><span class="author-p-1460">Associate a culturally specific image with the meaning and function of the term.</span></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Consistency_across_products_modules"><span class="author-p-1460">        Consistency across products &amp; modules</span></h4>

<div id="magicdomid68"><span class="author-p-1460">            Consistency in terminology use is supremely important as you translate terms and sentences that have the same meaning and application throughout the product. Once you have decided on a term for a given function (for example, the term "tab"), register it in a glossary for future use in other areas of the product.</span></div>
