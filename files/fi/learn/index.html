<p class="summary">Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to provide complete beginners to web development with all that they need to start coding simple websites.</p>

<p>The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable". From there you should be able to start making your own way, learning from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">the rest of MDN</a> and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.</p>

<p>If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging — we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The content in the learning area is being added to regularly. If you have questions regarding topics you'd like to see covered or feel are missing, see the {{anch("Contact us")}} section below for information on how to get in touch.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Where_to_start">Where to start</h2>

<ul class="card-grid">
 <li><span>Complete beginner:</span> If you are a complete beginner to web development, we'd recommend that you start by working through our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Getting started with the web</a> module, which provides a practical introduction to web development.</li>
 <li><span>Specific questions:</span> If you have a specific question about web development, our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions">Common questions</a> section may have something to help you.</li>
 <li><span>Beyond the basics:</span> If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn {{glossary("HTML")}} and {{glossary("CSS")}} in detail: start with our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a> module and move on to our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS">Introduction to CSS</a> module.</li>
 <li><span>Moving onto scripting:</span> If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move on to {{glossary("JavaScript")}} or server-side development. Begin with our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">JavaScript first steps</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps">Server-side first steps</a> modules.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Our <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">glossary</a> provides terminology definitions.</p>

 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS — Styling the web</a></dt>
 <dd>CSS is the language that we can use to style and lay out our web content, as well as adding behavior like animation. This topic provides comprehensive coverage of CSS.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript">JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting</a></dt>
 <dd>JavaScript is the scripting language used to add dynamic functionality to web pages. This topic teaches all the essentials needed to become comfortable with writing and understanding JavaScript.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">Accessibility — make the web usable by everyone</a></dt>
 <dd>Accessibility is the practice of making web content available to as many people as possible regardless of disability, device, locale, or other differentiating factors. This topic gives you all you need to know.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance">Web Performance — making websites fast and responsive</a></dt>
 <dd>Web performance is the art of making sure web applications download fast and are responsive to user interaction, regardless of a users bandwidth, screen size, network, or device capabilities.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing">Tools and testing</a></dt>
 <dd>This topic covers the tools developers use to facilitate their work, such as cross browser testing tools.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side">Server-side website programming</a></dt>
 <dd>Even if you are concentrating on client-side web development, it is still useful to know how servers and server-side code features work. This topic provides a general introduction to how the server-side works, and detailed tutorials showing how to build up a server-side app using two popular frameworks — Django (Python) and Express (node.js). </dd>

<h2 id="Getting_our_code_examples">Getting our code examples</h2>

<p>The code examples you'll encounter in the Learning Area are all <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/">available on GitHub</a>. If you want to copy them all to your computer, the easiest way is to <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/archive/master.zip">download a ZIP of the latest master code branch</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd rather copy the repo in a more flexible way that allows for automatic updates, you can follow the more complex instructions:</p>

<ol>
 <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Install Git</a> on your machine. This is the underlying version control system software that GitHub works on top of.</li>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/join">Sign up for a GitHub account</a>.</li>
 <li>Once you've signed up, log in to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> with your username and password.</li>
 <li>Open your computer's <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089">command prompt</a> (Windows) or terminal (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal">Linux</a>, <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">macOS</a>)</li>
 <li>To copy the learning area repo to a folder called learning-area in the current location your command prompt/terminal is pointing to, use the following command:
  <pre class="brush: bash">git clone https://github.com/mdn/learning-area</pre>
 </li>
 <li>You can now enter the directory and find the files you are after (either using your finder/file explorer or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)">cd command</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>You can update the <code>learning-area</code> repository with any changes made to the master version on GitHub with the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>In your command prompt/terminal, go inside the <code>learning-area</code> directory using <code>cd</code>. For example, if you were in the parent directory:

  <pre class="brush: bash">cd learning-area</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Update the repository using the following command:
  <pre class="brush: bash">git pull</pre>
 </li>
</ol>
