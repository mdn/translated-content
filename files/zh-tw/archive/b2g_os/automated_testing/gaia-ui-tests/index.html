 <p>Gaia-ui-tests 是 Mozilla 的一套用於自動測試 Gaia UI 的架構。所有的測試都是以 Python 撰寫，佐以少數的 Javascript 來與 Firefox OS 的 API 溝通。此一系列的教學文章將會描述如何設定環境、撰寫及執行測試。</p>
</div>
<p>Gaia-ui-tests uses <strong>Gaiatest</strong>, a Python package based around <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette">Marionette</a>. Gaiatest is designed to wrap HTML locators, Marionette calls and API calls together for interoperble communication and functionality. Marionette is based on the W3C standard developed for the <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/" title="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium WebDriver</a> a programming interface for browser automation. If you have used WebDriver and page/app objects before then you will find using Marionette and gaiatest easy.</p>

<p>For those keen to get started with automated testing on Gaia/Firefox OS we have a tutorial series that will help you go from nothing to writing your own tests. Once you've completed this tutorial you'll have enough knowledge of testing, Firefox OS and Marionette to get started as a Mozilla tests contributor. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you complete this tutorial if you wish to become a contributor.</p>

  Moving on, in this article we will assemble some basic commands into a simple test inside a Python file so they can all be run as a single entity.</dd>

 <dd>
  A test runner is a central feature of any good test suite, allowing you to run multiple tests and report and aggregate results. In this article we will explore the basics of Python's unittest runner.</dd>

 <dd>
  This time around we explain how to further reduce duplication of code, by storing repeated locators in tuples and simplifying the syntax with Marionette's <code>By</code> class.</dd>

  Now the basics and behind you, and it is time to start to writing your own tests! Here we give you some tool recommendations to make the work easier, and suggest some tests to try your hand at writing.</dd>

 <dd>
  In its current state, our test file contains all the test runner code. This is ok for now, but as soon as you start to run many test files it will mean a lot of duplication. Here we solve this problem by abstracting the test runner code into a separate Python class.</dd>

  As a final improvement to the code's maintainability, in this article we explore abstracting code that handles interaction with specific Firefox OS apps out into Python app objects.</dd>
