<p>Welcome to Mozilla localization (l10n for short)!</p>
<p>Whether you're here to start up your own localization in the Mozilla project or to join the efforts of an existing localization, you've come to the right place. This guide is filled with all of the basic, technical information you need to get involved in the Mozilla l10n program. We will take you through the steps to get started, from the initial environment setup to testing and releasing your own localization. Along the way, you'll learn about the variety of projects you can contribute to and the tools used to localize them.</p>
<p>When we get to specific examples, we'll take them from the Firefox project, as it is the most widely localized project within Mozilla. As you near the end of this guide, you should be able to make a change to Firefox in your local setting and then see that change in the Firefox interface. In closing, when you finish this guide, you will have all the tools necessary to start contributing!</p>
<p>Remember, this guide will instruct you on the technical aspects of Mozilla l10n only. Visit the <a class="link-https" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Localization_Process" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Overview">L10n Process</a> page to learn about the whole process.</p>
