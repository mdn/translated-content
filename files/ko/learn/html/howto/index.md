Once you've covered [the basics](/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics), there isn't one right path to learn {{Glossary("HTML")}}. You can pick up whatever you like at your own pace. HTML is simply a set of {{glossary("tag","tags")}} you can use to set up your document structure and add extra functionality to your document. The following articles explain thoroughly, with full working examples, how to use HTML for the most common, frequent Web development tasks. If you need a quick explanation of a tag, please head over to our [HTML reference](/ko/docs/Web/HTML/Reference).

## Common use cases

HTML covers a lot of very common use cases in Web design. It's highly likely you'll come across these scenarios:

### Basic structure

The most basic application of HTML is document structure. If you're new to HTML you should start with this.

### Basic text-level semantics

HTML specializes in providing semantic information for a document, so HTML answers many questions you might have about how to get your message across best in your document.
