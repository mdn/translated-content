<p>A major part of contributing to MDN documentation on any significant scale is knowing how to work as part of the MDN community. This article offers tips to help you make the most of your interactions with both other writers and with development teams.</p>

<h2 id="에티켓_가이드라인">에티켓 가이드라인</h2>

<p>Mozilla 커뮤니티와 함께 일하면서 지켜주셨으면 하는 사항들입니다.</p>

<ul>
 <li>예의를 지켜주세요! 합의점을 찾기 힘든 사항이더라도 우리 모두는 더 나은 웹을 만들고자하는 공통적인 목표가 있습니다.</li>
 <li>요구하기보다는 질문으로 정중하게 물어봐주세요. 요구할 때보다 정중하게 도움을 요청한다면 기대 이상의 좋은 답변을 기대하실 수 있을 것 입니다. 개발 커뮤니티 일원 모두 문서 작업이 중요하다는 사실을 인지하고 있습니다. 그러나 상대방에게 존중심이 부족한 말이나 행동은 그에 걸맞는 대우를 받을 수 있습니다. </li>
 <li>정보의 필요성과 긴급성, 그리고 다른 일원분들의 시간 투자를 염두에 두고 균형을 잘 조율해주시길 바랍니다. 정말로 필요한게 아니라면, 대화에 참가하고 있는 분들에게 폐를 끼칠 정도의 많은 정보를 요청하거나 재촉하지 말아주세요.</li>
 <li>당신의 요청은 다른 사람들의 소중한 시간을 사용하게 된다는 점을 염두에 두시고, 그 시간을 현명히 사용해주시길 바랍니다.</li>
 <li>문화적 차이에 대해 존중심을 보여주세요. Mozilla 는 다국적, 다문화적 팀입니다. 다른 사람과 대화할 때, 상대방의 문화를 염두에 두어주시길 바랍니다.</li>
 <li>진행 중인 대화에 끼어들기보다 새로운 대화를 시작해 주세요. Don't inject your questions into an unrelated conversation just because the people you need to talk to are paying attention to it. While convenient for you, this can irritate the people you're trying to talk to, and result in a less than ideal outcome.</li>
 <li>{{interwiki("wikipedia", "bikeshedding")}}는 자제해 주세요. 열정이 사소한 것에 대한 집착으로 이어지지 않도록 조심해주세요. 대화가 주제에서 이탈할 수 있고 불편해질 수 있습니다.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Be_tactful">Be tactful</h2>

<p>Always be tactful and respectful when communicating with others.</p>

<h3 id="Politely_pointing_out_mistakes">Politely pointing out mistakes</h3>

<p>If your purpose in contacting someone is to ask them to do something differently, or to point out a mistake they've been making (especially if they repeatedly do it), start your message with a positive comment. This softens the blow, so to speak, and it demonstrates that you're trying to be helpful, rather than setting you up as the bad guy.</p>

<p>For example, if a new contributor has been creating lots of pages without tags, and you'd like to point out this problem, your message to them might look like this (the stuff you'd need to change for each case is underlined):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>안녕하세요 홍길동씨, <u>웜홀 API 문서</u> 에 대한 홍길동씨의 기여에 대해 감사드립니다. 저는 특히 홍길동씨께서 <u>가독성과 세부정보를 균형있게 서술한 점을 인상깊게 보았습니다.</u> 아마도 작업하시면서 <u>correct tag를 페이지마다 추가해주신다면 </u>이 문서를 더 유익하고 잘 만들어 나갈 수 있을 것 같습니다.</p>

<p><u>자세한 사항은 MDN 태그가이드를 이용해 주세요(<a href="/ko/docs/MDN/Contribute?Howto/Tag/">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Tag</a>)</u></p>

<p>다시 한번 감사를 드리며 앞으로의 기여활동도 기대하겠습니다!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="지식_공유">지식 공유</h2>

<p>MDN 프로젝트에 참여하면서 무슨 일들이 일어나는지 파악하고 다른 멤버들과 소통하는 것이 본인에게 도움이 됩니다. 커뮤니티 내의 다른 분들과 소통하므로 아이디어를 얻거나 공유할 수 있습니다. 우리는 누가 주체가 되어 무슨 일을 진행하는지 알 수 있는 도구들과 리소스들을 제공하고 있습니다.</p>

<h3 id="Communication_channels">Communication channels</h3>

<p>There are several ways you can engage with community members (either developers or writers), each of which has some of its own particular rules of etiquette.</p>

<h4 id="Discourse">Discourse</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn">MDN Discourse forum</a> is a good place to ask general questions about MDN contribution and start discussions.</p>

<h4 id="Chat">Chat</h4>

<p>Use the Matrix chat system to reach people in real time. MDN staff members are available in the <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs room</a>, and are active during work days in Europe and North America. Explore the other chat rooms to find people involved in topics you're interested in.</p>

<h4 id="GitHub">GitHub</h4>

<p>If you find a problem on MDN, or want to ask a question, you can file an issue over on our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues">GitHub sprints repo issues</a>! They will then be triaged and actioned at some point in the future.</p>

<h4 id="Email">Email</h4>

<p>Sometimes, a private email exchange between you and one or more other people is the way to go, if you have their email address.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As a general rule, if someone has posted their email address on documents about the technology you're documenting, has given you their email address personally, or generally has a well-known email address, email is an acceptable "first contact" approach. If you have to dig for it, you probably should try to get permission Discourse or a mailing list first, unless you've exhausted all other attempts at getting in touch.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Content_status_tools">Content status tools</h3>

<p>We have several useful tools that provide information about the status of documentation content.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/dashboards/revisions">Revision dashboard</a></dt>
 <dd>The revision dashboard provides a fantastic tool to review changes made to MDN content. You can see recent history, choose a range of time to view, and filter based on things like locale, contributor's name, and topic. Once you're looking at a set of revisions, you can view the changes made in each revision, quickly open the page, see a full history, or even revert the changes (if you have those privileges).</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/Overview">Documentation status overview</a></dt>
 <dd>Our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/Overview">documentation status overview</a> page provides a list of all the areas of MDN that have been configured for status tracking, with information about how many pages therein need different types of work done. Click through to a particular topic area to see detailed lists of content that needs work, such as pages that have no tags, or are tagged with indicators that certain types of work need to be done. You can even see lists of pages that haven't been updated in a long time and may be out of date, as well as a list of bugs that have been flagged as impacting the documentation in that area.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Plans">Documentation project plans</a></dt>
 <dd>We have a number of writing projects that are in the planning stages, or are large and ongoing, for which we have written planning documents to help us keep track of what we need to get done.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/viya-mdn-durable-team">MDN Taiga</a></dt>
 <dd>The MDN staff writers use a tool called Taiga to manage current and future documentation projects. You can take a look to see what we're doing and how it's going, and you can see what projects we'd like to see happen soon. Some of those will be taken on by staff writers, but you should feel free to take one over if you like! For more information about the agile processes followed by the MDN team, see our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement/MDN_Durable_Team/Processes">Process page on the Mozilla wiki</a>.</dd>

<h2 id="The_development_community">The development community</h2>

<p>Possibly the most important relationships to develop and maintain, as a member of the MDN writing community, are those you develop and sustain with the developers. They create the software we're developing, but they're also the most useful source of information we have. It's crucial that we maintain good relations with developers—the more they like you, the more likely they are to answer your questions quickly, accurately, and thoroughly!</p>

<p>In addition, you represent the MDN writing community. Please help ensure we keep our excellent working relationship with the dev team by making every interaction they have with the writing team be a good one.</p>

<p>On a related note, a great way to find the right person to talk to is to look at the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules">module owners lists</a>.</p>

<h2 id="The_writing_community">The writing community</h2>

<p>The writing community is a large one. While the number of extremely frequent, or large-scale contributors is relatively small, there are many dozens or hundreds of people who contribute at least now and then. Fortunately, these are by and large awesome people with a genuine love of the Web, Mozilla, and/or documentation, and interacting with them is almost always pretty easy.</p>

<p>See the article <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Community" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Join_the_community">Join the community</a> for more information about the MDN community.</p>

<p>The most frequent place you'll directly interact with other writers is in the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn">Discourse forum</a>.</p>

<p>By keeping in mind the {{anch("General etiquette guidelines")}}, you'll find that usually, things go very smoothly.</p>
