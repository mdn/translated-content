<p><span class="seoSummary">The App Manager is a tool for Firefox Desktop which provides a number of useful tools to help developers test, deploy and debug HTML5 web apps on Firefox OS phones &amp; Simulator, directly from Firefox browser. This page documents how to use the App Manager.</span></p>

<p>App Manager is available for Firefox OS 1.2 or later, lower versions are supported in <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_1.1_Simulator">Firefox OS 1.1 Simulator</a>. The App Manager is being replaced by the <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a>, starting from Firefox 33. The WebIDE provides all the features of the App Manager and also features an editing environment to create and develop Firefox OS apps.</p>
</div>

<p>{{EmbedYouTube("z1Bxg1UJVf0")}}</p>

<p>The App Manager is composed of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>An <a href="#Apps_panel"><em>Apps panel</em></a>, which manages local apps (app source code located on your computer) and apps hosted externally, allowing you to package and install them on your device or simulator, and debug them using Toolboxes</li>
 <li>A <a href="#Device_panel"><em>Device panel</em></a>, which displays information about the connected device including Firefox OS version installed, permissions required for using device APIs on the device, and apps installed</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Tools_Toolbox"><em>Toolboxes</em></a>, which are are sets of developer tools (web console, inspector, debugger, etc.) that can be connected to a running app via the Apps panel to perform debugging operations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Device_and_system_configuration">Device and system configuration</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll need to do when using the App Manager is make sure your system and phone are set up correctly. This section will run through all the steps required.</p>

<h3 id="Firefox_OS_1.2_required">Firefox OS 1.2+ required</h3>

<p>Make sure your device is running Firefox OS 1.2/Boot2Gecko 1.2 or higher. To check which version of Firefox OS the device is runing, go to <code>Settings &gt; Device Information &gt; Software</code>.</p>

<p>If you don't have a high enough version installed, depending on what phone you have you will need to either install an available nightly build of Firefox 1.2+, or configure and build it yourself from source.</p>

<p>Builds available:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://downloads.geeksphone.com/">Geeksphone Keon/Peak builds</a> (to find out more about using these, read <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide/Updating_and_Tweaking_Geeksphone">Updating and Tweaking your Firefox OS Developer Preview phone/Geeksphone</a>)</li>
 <li>More to follow</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To build your own Firefox OS 1.2+ distribution, follow the instructions located at <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Building_and_installing_Firefox_OS">Building and installing Firefox OS</a>, starting with <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites">Firefox OS build prerequisites</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Remote_debugging">Remote debugging</h3>

<p>Next, you need to enable remote debugging in Firefox OS. To do so, go to <code>Settings &gt; Device information &gt; More information &gt; Developer</code> and check the Remote Debugging checkbox.</p>

<h3 id="Adb_Helper_Add-on" name="Adb_Helper_Add-on">ADB or ADB helper</h3>

<p>The process uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to handle the device-computer connection and communication. There are two options for running ADB:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Let Firefox handle ADB (recommended). <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/">Install the ADB Helper add-on</a>, which makes the process easier. With this installed, there's no need to install the ADB, and no need to type the <code>adb forward</code> command: everything is handled by the add-on.</p>
  <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 10px; text-align: center; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; background-color: #81BC2E; white-space: nowrap; color: white; text-shadow: 0px 1px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); box-shadow: 0px 1px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0px -1px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) inset;" title="https://addons.mozilla.org">Download ADB Helper Add-on</a></li>
 <li>Use ADB manually. You need to have it installed on your computer: download and install <code>adb</code> as explained in <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Installing_ADB">Installing ADB</a>. You'll need to enable port forwarding by entering the following command into your terminal:
  <pre>adb forward tcp:6000 localfilesystem:/data/local/debugger-socket</pre>
  Note that you'll need to do this every time the phone is restarted or unplugged then re-plugged.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There's no need to run this command if you installed the ADB Helper Add-on.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Connecting_your_device_to_the_App_Manager">Connecting your device to the App Manager</h2>

<p>With all your configuration done, it's now time to plug your device into your computer and start the App Manager:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Plug the device into your computer via USB.</li>
 <li>Disable Screen lock on your device by going to <code>Settings &gt; Screen Lock</code> and unchecking the <code>Lock Screen</code> checkbox. This is a good idea because when the screen gets locked, the phone connection gets lost, meaning it is no longer available for debugging.</li>
 <li>Start the App Manager — In Firefox Desktop select the <code>Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; App Manager</code> menu option, or type <code>about:app-manager</code> in the URL bar.</li>
 <li>At the bottom of the App Manager tab, you will see a connection status bar (see screenshot below). You should be able to connect your device by clicking the "Connect to localhost:6000" button.</li>
 <li>If this works successfully, a prompt should appear on your device: "An incoming request to permit remote debugging connection was detected. Allow connection?". Tap the OK button (You may also have to press the power button on the phone so you can see the prompt.) The connection status bar should update to say "Connected to B2G", with a Disconnect button available to press if you want to cancel the connection.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6263/connection-status.png" style="display: block; height: 30px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The other controls in the connection status bar allow you to connect a simulator to the App Manager, which we cover in the next section, below, and change the port that the connection happens on. If you change the port, you'll also need to enable port forwarding for this port as well, as instructed in the {{anch("Enable port forwarding")}} section, above.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Using_a_Firefox_OS_Simulator_Add-on"><a name="Simulator">Using a Firefox OS Simulator Add-on</a></h2>

<p>If you haven't got a real device available to use with App Manager, you can still try it out using a <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator">Firefox OS Simulator</a> Add-on. To start off, install the simulator with the following button (multiple versions are available; you are advised to install them all, for maximum flexibility):</p>

<p><a class="download-button external ignore-external" href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/" rel="noopener">Install Simulator</a></p>


<p>Once you've installed the simulator(s), you need to go to about:app-manager to see the connection status bar at the bottom of the App Manager tab, and click the "Start simulator" button. At least three buttons will appear:</p>

<ul>
 <li>"Firefox OS 1.3", "Firefox OS 1.2" ... etc. (or something similar): the left-most buttons contain the names of the simulator versions you have installed. Click one to start a connection to a simulator.</li>
 <li>"Add": the middle button navigates to the simulator install links in this article, so you can add more Simulators (Firefox OS 1.3, Firefox OS 1.4, etc.)</li>
 <li>"Cancel": the right hand button cancels the connection.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Firefox OS 1.5 Simulator has been removed, as 1.5 was changed to 2.0. If you have the Firefox OS 1.5 Simulator installed, it won't automatically update to 2.0, so you should uninstall 1.5 and install 2.0 instead. The Firefox OS 2.0 simulator will then automatically update.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Firefox OS 1.2 Simulator has been removed, as no phones are likely to be released with version 1.2 installed — this version is therefore of limited value, and it makes more sense to spend your time debugging on other versions.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Running_custom_builds_in_the_App_Manager">Running custom builds in the App Manager</h2>

<p>Note that you can run custom B2G Desktop and Gaia/Gecko builds in the App Manager via the simulator. Read <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Running_custom_builds_in_the_App_Manager">Running custom Firefox OS/Gaia builds in the App Manager</a> for instructions on how to do this.</p>

<h2 id="Apps_panel_Test_and_debug_Firefox_OS_apps"><a name="Apps_panel">Apps panel</a>: Test and debug Firefox OS apps</h2>

<p>Now that everything is working, let's review the functionality available inside the App Manager, starting with the Apps panel. From here, you can import an existing app to push onto your device, for testing and debugging:</p>

<ul>
 <li>To install a locally stored app, click on the plus next to the "Add Packaged App" label and use the resulting file chooser dialog to select the directory your app is contained inside.</li>
 <li>To install an externally hosted app, enter the absolute URL of the app's manifest file into the text field inside the "Add Hosted App" box, then press the plus button.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information about your app should appear on the right hand side of the window, as seen below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6261/apps-panel.png" style="display: block; height: 375px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<h3 id="Manifest_editor">Manifest editor</h3>

<p>From Firefox 28 onwards, the Apps Panel includes an editor for the app manifest:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6613/apps-panel-fx-28.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<h3 id="Debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>Clicking on <em>"Update"</em> will update (install) the app on the device. Clicking on <em>"debug"</em> will connect a toolbox to the app, allowing you to debug its code directly:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6265/debug.png" style="display: block; height: 375px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<div class="note">
<p>You'll enjoy playing around with the toolbox — try altering the DOM, CSS etc. and you'll see the updates reflected on the device in realtime. Such updates will be saved on the installed app code; you'll see them next time you open the app on the device.</p>
</div>

<p>Before Firefox 28, the tools are launched in a separate window. From Firefox 28 onwards, the tools are launched in a separate tab in the App Manager itself, alongside the Apps and Device tabs. The tab is given your app's icon so it's easy to find:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6615/toolbox-fx-28.png" style="display: block; height: 375px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<h3 id="Errors">Errors</h3>

<p>If an app was not added successfully — for example if the URL was incorrect, or you selected a packaged app folder — an entry will be added to the page for this app, but this will include error information.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6259/apps-error.png" style="display: block; height: 375px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<p>You can also delete an app from this view, by hovering over the App name/description on the left of the window, and pressing the "X" button that appears in each case. This however doesn't remove the app from the device. To do that you need to manually remove the app using the device itself.</p>

<h2 id="Device_panel_2"><a name="Device_panel">Device panel</a></h2>

<p>The <em>Device</em> tab displays information about the connected device. From the <em>"</em>Installed Apps<em>"</em> window, apps on the device can be started and debugged.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6267/device-tab.png" style="display: block; height: 375px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<div class="note">
<p>Note: Certified Apps are not listed by default. <a href="#Debugging_Certified_Apps">See how to debug certified apps</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="permissions"></a>The "Permissions" window shows the required privileges for different <a href="/en-US/docs/WebAPI">Web APIs</a> on the current device:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6269/permissions.png" style="display: block; height: 375px; margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;"></p>

<p>Finally, you can take a screenshot of the current device display by clicking the "Screenshot" button. The screenshot appears in a new tab on Firefox, and from there you can save or discard it as you wish.</p>

<h2 id="Debugging_Certified_Apps_2"><a name="Debugging_Certified_Apps">Debugging Certified Apps</a></h2>

<p>Currently only devices running a development build of Firefox OS 1.2+ are capable of debugging certified apps. If you have a development build, you can enable certified app debugging by changing the pref <code>devtools.debugger.forbid-certified-apps</code> to <code>false</code> in your profile. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>

<h3 id="Using_a_real_device">Using a real device</h3>

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>On your computer, enter the following command in Terminal/console to enter your device's filesystem via the shell:</p>

  <pre class="brush: bash">adb shell</pre>

  <p>Your prompt should change to <code>root@android</code>.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Next, stop B2G running using the following command:</p>

  <pre class="brush: bash">stop b2g</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Navigate to the following directory:</p>

  <pre>cd /data/b2g/mozilla/*.default/</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Here, update the prefs.js file with the following line:</p>

  <pre class="brush: js">echo 'user_pref("devtools.debugger.forbid-certified-apps", false);' &gt;&gt; prefs.js</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>After you've finished editing and saving the file, start B2G again using the following command:</p>

  <pre class="brush: bash">start b2g</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Exit the android filesystem using the <code>exit</code> command; this will return you to your normal terminal prompt.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Next, reconnect to the App Manager and you should see certified apps appear for debugging.</p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Using_the_B2G_desktop_client">Using the B2G desktop client</h3>

<p class="brush: js">With the B2G desktop client, the preference is already defined in your profile in <code>greprefs.js</code>, located at the root of your B2G desktop client folder. Stop your B2G desktop client and edit the file to turn the <code>devtools.debugger.forbid-certified-apps</code> preference to <code>false</code>. Then restart the B2G client and connect the App Manager. You should now see all applications.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Note: If you want to add this preference to your Gaia build you can run <code>make DEVICE_DEBUG=1 reset-gaia</code>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting_2"><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p id="My_device_is_not_recognized">If the device is not recognized:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If clicking the button corresponding to your Firefox OS phone doesn't do anything, make sure you haven't connected an Android phone at the same time as the Firefox OS phone to your computer.</li>
 <li>Read the <a href="#Configuring_device">Device and system configuration</a> section thoroughly, and make sure all the steps are followed:</li>
 <li>Is your device running at least Firefox OS 1.2?</li>
 <li>Don't see all the apps? Do you need to enable <a href="#Debugging_Certified_Apps">Certified Apps debugging</a>?</li>
 <li>Did you enable "Remote Debugging" in the settings of your phone?</li>
 <li>If you are not using the <a href="#Adb_Helper_Add-on">ADB Helper add-on</a>:
  <ul>
   <li>Did you successfully run the <code>adb forward</code> command?</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>If you are using the <a href="#Adb_Helper_Add-on">ADB Helper add-on</a> and your device is not listed in the bottom toolbar:
  <ul>
   <li>If you use Linux, <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up">make sure to setup udev correctly</a></li>
   <li>If you use Windows, <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up">make sure to install the appropriate drivers</a></li>
   <li>You can also enable verbose logging to gather diagnostics:
    <ul>
     <li>Use about:config to set the pref "<span class="message"><span class="content"><span class="email">extensions.adbhelper@mozilla.org.sdk</span>.console.logLevel"</span></span> to the string value "all"</li>
     <li>Disable and re-enable the ADB Helper add-on from the add-ons manager, or restart Firefox</li>
     <li>Open the App Manager again</li>
     <li>In the <a href="/docs/Tools/Browser_Console">Browser Console</a>, you should now see additional output lines that mention "adbhelper"</li>
     <li>If you see them but aren't sure what they mean, stop by the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/GetInvolved#Communication">#devtools room on IRC</a> or <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?alias=&amp;assigned_to=nobody%40mozilla.org&amp;attach_text=&amp;blocked=&amp;bug_file_loc=http%3A%2F%2F&amp;bug_ignored=0&amp;bug_severity=normal&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;cf_blocking_b2g=---&amp;cf_crash_signature=&amp;cf_status_b2g18=---&amp;cf_status_b2g_1_1_hd=---&amp;cf_status_b2g_1_2=---&amp;cf_status_firefox24=---&amp;cf_status_firefox25=---&amp;cf_status_firefox26=---&amp;cf_status_firefox27=---&amp;cf_status_firefox_esr17=---&amp;cf_status_firefox_esr24=---&amp;cf_tracking_b2g18=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox24=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox25=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox26=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox27=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox_esr17=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox_esr24=---&amp;cf_tracking_firefox_relnote=---&amp;cf_tracking_relnote_b2g=---&amp;comment=&amp;component=Developer%20Tools%3A%20App%20Manager&amp;contenttypeentry=&amp;contenttypemethod=autodetect&amp;contenttypeselection=text%2Fplain&amp;data=&amp;defined_groups=1&amp;dependson=&amp;description=&amp;flag_type-203=X&amp;flag_type-37=X&amp;flag_type-41=X&amp;flag_type-5=X&amp;flag_type-607=X&amp;flag_type-720=X&amp;flag_type-721=X&amp;flag_type-737=X&amp;flag_type-748=X&amp;flag_type-781=X&amp;flag_type-787=X&amp;flag_type-791=X&amp;flag_type-799=X&amp;flag_type-800=X&amp;flag_type-802=X&amp;flag_type-803=X&amp;flag_type-809=X&amp;flag_type-825=X&amp;form_name=enter_bug&amp;keywords=&amp;maketemplate=Remember%20values%20as%20bookmarkable%20template&amp;op_sys=All&amp;priority=--&amp;product=Firefox&amp;qa_contact=developer.tools%40firefox.bugs&amp;rep_platform=x86&amp;requestee_type-203=&amp;requestee_type-41=&amp;requestee_type-5=&amp;requestee_type-607=&amp;requestee_type-748=&amp;requestee_type-781=&amp;requestee_type-787=&amp;requestee_type-791=&amp;requestee_type-800=&amp;short_desc=&amp;status_whiteboard=&amp;target_milestone=---&amp;version=Trunk">file a bug</a> with the log output</li>
