<div class="summary"><span class="seoSummary">B2G OS is (was) a complete, standalone operating system for the open web. It is an open source project developed by the Mozilla community and forms the basis of Firefox OS products. As of 2017 it is<strong> no longer maintained</strong>.</span></div>

<p><strong>B2G OS </strong>is a community maintained open source operating system for<strong> </strong>smartphones, tablets, smart TVs and other connected devices. The project was <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Booting_to_the_Web">started</a> in 2011 and is based on the Linux kernel and Gecko rendering engine. The entire user interface is built using web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and can be used to launch and use <a href="/en-US/Apps">web applications</a>. Since Mozilla <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/firefox-os-connected-devices-announcement/6864">discontinued</a> their commercial Firefox OS smartphone program the smartphone part of the project is entirely maintained by Mozilla's volunteer community, and branded as B2G OS.</p>

 <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/Building_the_B2G_OS_simulator">Building the B2G OS Simulator</a></dt>
 <dd class="landingPageList">Just like <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org" title="http://nightly.mozilla.org">Firefox Nightlies</a>, the B2G OS simulator desktop client (identified by <em>b2g-</em>) is automatically built every day from the latest source code. The latest build is <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/" title="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/">available from the Mozilla FTP server</a>. Be sure to pick the latest version and the right archive for your operating system. This lets you bypass having to build it yourself. In addition, you don't have to download Gaia on your own either.</dd>

 <dd class="landingPageList">The <code>.userconfig</code> file isn't checked into source code control, so your changes won't be overwritten when you update your source tree. It needs to be created in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G">root of the B2G tree</a>; that is, in the same directory as <code>flash.sh</code>, <code>build.sh</code>, and so forth. You should add this before you run your config and build steps.</dd>

 <dd class="landingPageList">There are two main types of debugging you'll want to with Firefox OS: debugging apps, and debugging other aspects of the system.</dd>
 <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/Developer_Mode">Developer Mode</a></dt>
 <dd class="landingPageList">The current Firefox OS permissions model precludes modification and installation of certified/internal apps, which makes some device APIs completely unavailable to Marketplace and web apps. <strong>Developer Mode (DM)</strong> allows the user to indicate that they would like to relax the permissions model and expose all device APIs to content, as well as setting a group of related preferences. This article provides a high-level overview.</dd>
