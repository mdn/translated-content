<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p>MDN is used by people all over the world as a reference and guide to Web technologies, as well as to the internals of Firefox itself. Our localization communities are a key part of the Mozilla project; their work in translating and localizing our documentation helps people around the world develop for the open Web. If you'd like to learn more about our localization teams, join one of the teams, or even start a new localization, this is the place to begin.</p>
