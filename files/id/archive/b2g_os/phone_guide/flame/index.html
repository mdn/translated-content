<p><span class="seoSummary">The Flame device is the official reference device for developing, testing, and debugging Firefox OS and open web apps. This guide provides basic information about its hardware specifications as well as practical documentation specific to experimenting with, developing for, and testing of software compatible with this phone.</span></p>

<p>The Flame hardware offers a representative set of specs — including FWVGA display and dual-core processor — to help developers build great content and experiences. A stable hardware platform is also good for testers, making it easier to test and address specific software issues without having to worry about device model-specific bugs, etc.</p>
