<p><span id="result_box" lang="id"><span title="This tutorial is meant to be the stepping stone that will turn you into a professional Firefox extension developer in no time.">Tutorial ini dimaksudkan untuk menjadi batu loncatan yang akan mengubah Anda menjadi seorang pengembang ekstensi Firefox profesional dalam waktu singkat . </span><span title="We have poured years of XUL experience into it, providing many solutions for problems extension developers commonly run into.">Kami telah dituangkan tahun pengalaman XUL ke dalamnya , menyediakan banyak solusi untuk masalah pengembang ekstensi pada umumnya.</span></span></p>
<p>XUL School was created by <a href="http://appcoast.com/" title="http://appcoast.com/">Appcoast</a> (formerly Glaxstar), one of the few companies dedicated to building high-quality Firefox extensions. A team of over a dozen XUL developers conformed Glaxstar at the time this tutorial was created, and the combined experiences of years creating Firefox extensions are reflected here.</p>
<p>With this tutorial you'll learn how to develop Firefox extensions. You'll learn how to quickly do the most common tasks in extension development, comparing several different approaches to solve them. In most cases we'll provide code samples that you can easily copy and adapt to your needs, as well as some working example extensions. The tutorial aims to be as brief as possible, often falling back on Mozilla documentation for more detailed information. You can think of it as a quick guide to the expansive world that is the Mozilla platform. Most links in this documentation are meant to be clicked and read.</p>
<p>We'll start with a brief introduction to some key concepts, in case you're not familiar with Mozilla and Firefox.</p>
<h2 id="Mozilla_and_Firefox">Mozilla and Firefox</h2>
<p>The term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a> can be used to refer to several concepts: the Mozilla project, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation">Mozilla Corporation</a> and the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite">Mozilla browser</a>. Even Firefox is sometimes referred to as "Mozilla". If you're unfamiliar with these terms, it's good that you take some time and learn a little about Mozilla. This will help you understand the culture that surrounds the Mozilla community.</p>
<p>Mozilla has spawned several <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/" title="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/">products and projects</a>, the most notable being the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Firefox is one of the most successful open source projects in history, combining the openness, standards-compliance and sophistication of open source with the focus on user experience and powerful outreach more commonly seen in less open companies.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of Firefox was released in November 2004, version 2.0 in October 2006, and version 3.0 in June 2008. This tutorial was written after Firefox 3 was released, and has been updated with time. While most of it should still work for creating extensions Firefox 3 (and even Firefox 2), it is strongly recommended that you aim to support modern Firefox versions, to encourage users to stay up to date with security fixes. A release that is more than 6 months old is likely vulnerable to published security bugs.</p>
<p>Firefox and other Mozilla applications can be seen as composed of two different parts: a user interface layer that is distinct for each project, and a common platform on top of which the interface layer is built. The user interface is built with technology known as <a href="/en-US/docs/XUL" title="XUL">XUL</a>, and the platform is known as <a href="/en-US/docs/XULRunner" title="XULRunner">XULRunner</a>.</p>
<h2 id="XUL">XUL</h2>
<p><a href="/en-US/docs/XUL" title="XUL">XUL</a> (pronounced "zool") is one of many technologies used for creating Mozilla-based products and extensions. It is only one part of the development landscape, but given that it's practically exclusive to Mozilla, it tends to be used to identify all Mozilla-related development. You'll sometimes read terms like "XUL applications" and "XUL extensions", but rarely will they refer to projects that are exclusively built with XUL. It usually means that the projects were built using Mozilla technologies. Even this project, called XUL School, covers several other technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, XBL and XPCOM.</p>
<h2 id="XULRunner">XULRunner</h2>
<p><a href="/en-US/docs/XULRunner" title="XULRunner">XULRunner</a> includes the <a href="/en-US/docs/Gecko" title="Gecko">Gecko rendering engine</a>, the <a href="/en-US/docs/Necko" title="Necko">Necko networking library</a>, and several other components that provide OS-independent file management, accessibility, and localization, among others. It is this very powerful platform that has allowed such a fast growth of the development community surrounding Mozilla and Firefox.</p>
<p>XULRunner is available in binary form at the <a href="/en-US/docs/XULRunner" title="XULRunner">XULRunner</a> page, and it is the base for several projects, such as Songbird, Miro and Eudora. There's a very comprehensive list of XULRunner applications in the <a href="/en-US/docs/XULRunner_Hall_of_Fame" title="XULRunner Hall of Fame">XULRunner Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Gecko">Gecko</h3>
<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Gecko" title="Gecko">Gecko engine</a> is the part of Firefox used to render web pages and its own user interface. You can identify the level of compatibility of web standards in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#Gecko-based_browsers" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#Gecko-based_browsers">Gecko-based browsers</a> looking at their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">User Agent</a> string, which should include the Gecko version. Gecko versions are somewhat independent from Firefox versions, and you can see a mapping of Firefox versions and Gecko versions at the <a href="/en-US/docs/Gecko" title="Gecko">Gecko page</a>. The User Agent String for Firefox at the time of this writing (in US English, Mac OS X) is:</p>
<p>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:<strong>7.0.1</strong>) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1</p>
<p>The highlighted section is the Gecko version: 7.0.1. You can read and copy the user agent string of any Firefox window, choosing "Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information" from the main menu.</p>
<h2 id="On_to_the_Tutorial">On to the Tutorial</h2>
<p>With the basic concepts out of the way, we can now get right into extension development. You are probably still wondering what exactly is an extension, what can it do, and how can you make them. Well, this whole tutorial is devoted to explaining that to you.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of extension development. Now let's get to it.</p>
